### Course Outline
We will cover the basics of programming with python as well as some more advanced features. The
topics will be broken up into four modules as such:

- Python Fundamentals
    * Introduction, Installation, and Basic Syntax
    * Variables, Arithmetic and Boolean Operations, Scalar and Structured Data Types
    * Conditional Flow and Loops, Defining Functions

- Beyond Base Python
    * Creating/Installing Modules, Docstrings, Conda vs. Pip
    * Numpy, Ndarrays, Ufuncs, Aggregations
    * Matplotlib, Point/Line Plots,  Contour/3D Plots, Subplots/Customization

- Advanced Python
    * Classes, Attributes, Methods, Polymorphism
    * List Comprehension, Flexible Arguments, Map/Filter
    * File IO, Command Line Arguments, OS and Sys modules

- Scientific Python
    * Scipy, Linalg, Stats, Interpolate, Optimize 
    * Pandas, DataFrames, Time Series 
    * Machine Learning, Scikit-Learn, Student Presentations

In addition to the outline above, we will have select lectures on specific math topics, including but not limited to:

- Ordinary Differential Equations
- Numerical Calculus
- Random Numbers/Monte Carlo
